<h1>The Best Movies according to Jha-Two</h1>
<h2>My Top Three movies of all time:</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Donny Darko</h3>
<p>Donnie Darko, an awkward teenager, befriends Frank, a figure in a bunny costume only he can see, who informs Donnie that 
the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds.</p>
<p>A Sci-Fi Thriller movie starring the young Jake Gyllenhall. It is based on a creepy pasta of a Bunny, and includes the 
element of Time travel to give the viewer a good movie session.</p>
<h3>Tenet</h3>
<p>When a few objects that can be manipulated and used as weapons in the future fall into the wrong hands, a CIA operative, 
known as the Protagonist, must save the world.</p>
<p>Yet another Christopher Nolan blockbuster, Tenet is a Sci-Fi Action Thriller Film. The concept of time manipulation is used
and the ending and the start of the movie are shown parallely, only for it all to be concluded in the middle.</p>
<h3>No Time To Die</h3>
<p>After leaving the active services, James Bond leads a peaceful life in Jamaica. However, a call for help from an old friend 
triggers a confrontation with a treacherous enemy.</p>
<p>How can I not add a James Bond Film to the list. This man, written by Ian Fleming, has been my idol and Daniel Craig 
flawlessly potrayed the character of Bond. This film is the conclusion of Craig Bond saga and is the only Bond Film, which has 
shown the prospect of having a female, black James Bond in the future, making the role culturaly and diverse and thus connecting
more and more people with the Bond Identity.</p>
